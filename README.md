**GreenSync Project**

1) The problem we are trying to solve is that many plant owners, especially working professionals struggle to water their plants on time due to busy schedules, frequent travel, or simply forgetting. This often leads to poor plant health or even death. Even old people, who are often passionate about gardening, may face similar challenges due to forgetfulness or mobility issues.

2) Our target customers would be working professionals, old-aged people & people who has to travel or stay away from home oftenly.

3) Our UVP is that all the self-watering pots made till date are passive systems(pre-set scheduling systems). our solution offers an intelligent and flexible watering system integrated with a web platform. This platform monitors real-time environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and soil moisture using sensors. Users can remotely adjust, reschedule, or override watering times anytime and anywhere with internet access, ensuring their plants get the right amount of water exactly when they need it.
